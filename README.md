#Background Colour Changer

This project was inspired by Online Tutorials' video linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj9JpCuMV60&t=264s. However, instead of choosing colours from an array, I decided to randomize the colours from all the colours possible.

During this project I learned how to "transform: translate" the button so that it was perfectly centered.
